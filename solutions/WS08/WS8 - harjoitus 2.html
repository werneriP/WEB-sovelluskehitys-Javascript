<h1>Workshop 8: Parsing JSON/XML with AJAX</h1>
<hr />
<p>In this exercise we will practice the use of JSON in our JavaScript applications. Use the lecture-material as a
  reference guide side by side these exercises. </p>



<h2>Exercise 2: Parsing JSON from web</h2>
<p>&nbsp;Below you see two buttons. Edit the source code and add an onClick-events to these buttons. Add functionality
  to these as described below.</p>
<button onclick=" loadJSONDoc()">Load raw data</button>
<button onclick=" loadJSONDocWithParse()">Load and parse the data</button>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first button should run a JavaScript-function, which will <a>load a JSON file from the web </a>and display the
    raw
    contents of it on the DIV-below (id=rawdata). Use Developer tools (F12) to track the AJAX call and study the
    headers, execution times etc.</li>
  <li> The second button should run a function, will load the same data, but will parse the data out and display it as a
    table.
  <li> After you have managed to get the data out, try to load the pictures to the page as well.
</ul>
<div id="rawdata">Raw data goes here.</div>
